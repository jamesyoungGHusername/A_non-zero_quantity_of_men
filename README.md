Client:
As a restaurant owner
When a client visits my website I want them to be able to log in.
Once they have logged in, I want them to be able to view my menu.
When they click on a menu item it's added to their order.
When the customer logs out and reopens the page later, I want the page to remember their incomplete order.
If a customer wants, they should be able to 'favorite' orders.
When a customer completes an order, they need to select whether it's for delivery or pickup
If it's for delivery they need to enter their address.
I want the customer to be able to either pay with a credit card online, or select "pay in cash".
